      Of all of the cultural aspects examined during localization, the artwork and animation unique to Chrono Trigger were left untouched in both the video game and its physical ephemera. This aesthetic, known as 「アニメ」 anime, is a unique Japanese artistic expression that grew in popularity after the second World War. The anime aesthetic follows a complex visual language imbued with exaggerated facial and bodily expressions, unnatural hair styles and colors, and most characteristically, large, prominent, and expressive eyes.<br><br>

      These visual components are most obvious when displayed on the various posters, manuals, and boxes marketed to consumers. The primary discrepancies between the Japanese release and the North American release was the distinctive branding on the box and the inclusion of two double-sided posters for Western audiences. In particular, the box art differed by the fighting focus depicted on the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) box and the more neutral and communal pose held by the characters in the Japanese release.<br><br>

      This ultimately reflects the separate cultures and gaming ecologies that were present at the time, as well as the marketing directives undertaken by Nintendo of Japan and Nintendo of America — which were primarily male-oriented at the time. In March 1994 (a year before Chrono Trigger’s release), “in its annual consumer survey, the Software Publishing Association reported that 21 percent of the purchasers and primary users of video games [in America] are female.”1 Director of marketing and corporate communications at Nintendo of America, George Harrison, stated in a 1994 interview that, although Nintendo of America had game content guidelines, it had no official policy on the gender-bias issue — "we tend to do what most publishers do — follow our nose to where the business is. It has been less of an exclusion of women than it has been following our nose to where the business is."1 This gender-gap led to gender-specific marketing ploys, especially pertaining to box cover art — which strived for a “macho appeal.” This concept is characterized as a “masculine-coded space,” that is colored with themes of “hypersexualized and objectified women, aggressive men, and signs relating to violence or war.”2
